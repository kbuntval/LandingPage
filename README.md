Landing Page for The Odin Project

Design Ideas:

Theme it about your favorite pet, Skypaw.

Quote that will live on the landing page:

"I think in a different life I was supposed to be a dog. I love da belly rubs and the head scratches and I also scarf my food too often. My caretakers still give me all the cuddles though."

Pictures of Skypaw with captions:

"Skypaw being majestic"

"Skypaw being not so majestic"

"Chonker!"

"This is my roast chicken pose"
